Title: Brick Breaker 
Author: Vasil Markov

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
- A simple version of the original brick breaker game with a few twists. Once the game is loaded, the ball is set to start moving immediately. 
- Use the cursor keys to move the paddle left and right. When a life is lost click on the screen to begin again. Once all lives are used up the game is over!
- Destroy all the bricks to win the game. Each brick is 10 points and is destroyed when the ball makes contact. Each brick broken has a 30% chance to drop the laser powerup. This value can be changed in the code. 

INSTALLING/RUNNING THE GAME:
If the project folder is zipped, make sure to extract all of it's contents in the same directory. The game will most likely not work if the files are not kept together. To load up the game, simply open the index.html file in the project folder. You will need a browser to run the game.

MAJOR COMPONENTS:
- The code is sectioned into 5 parts. The sections include the variables needed for the game, the "preload" function, the "create" function, the "update" function and the remaining functions needed to make individual components work.
- The variables are at the tope of the code right after the "script" tag. The variables have corresponding names to what they are being used for. 
- PRELOAD: The preload function is necessary for loading up all the assets into memory so the game can use them. This function also sets several scaling options and the background color.
- CREATE: The create function is responsible for configuring several of the playable components. This includes configuring the ball, bullets from the powerup, the paddle, player controls and more!
- UPDATE: The update function keeps track of collisions and player input. 
- The remainder of the functions all contribute to making the game work properly. Several of the collision functions are here and provide the necessary logic for collisions. The bricks are generated by the initBricks() function and the state of the game is tracked by the ballLeavesScreen() function.
